## Road map of creating this (didn't use this, instead i learned a different method)

Originally my idea was to either follow a guide and completely code it through or if that didn't work then it was to learn how to use python and scrape instagram for all the captions. But as I was doing more searching, I thankfully came across a linkedin post that was about them using basic instagram api to get all their followers. They provided links and pictures of how it worked and I luckily was able to check them out. That post lifted me off the ground as I was stuck prior, trying to follow a 10 step video on youtube for instagram api using an unfamiliar langauge(php). The linkedin post provided me what to look for and so I learned and created my own webpage using instagram basic API.
