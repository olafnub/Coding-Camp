Instagram API - https://youtu.be/RI4d2TeTFws

## Road map of creating this (didn't use this, instead i learned a different method)

Originally my idea was to either follow a guide and completely code it through, but as I was doing some searching, I thankfully came across a linkedin post and that post was able to get me lifted off the ground. It thought we what to look for and I was able to learn and create my own version of instagram captions API. 

ROADMAP

## SOLUTION 1
Get access token
Get userâ€™s pages / Facebook id connected to the instagram account
Get users instagram business page id
Get instagram media objects
Then use all media ids to get their captions

## SOLUTION 2
